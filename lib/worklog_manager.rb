  #                         - duration | d [pos] [duration] (e.g. 'd 3 30m', it changes the duration of the issue
  #                                  at position 3 to 30 minutes).
  #                                 Pass 'auto' to automatically expand the duration to fill the required working hours.
  #                         - remove | r [pos] (e.g 'r 3', remove from the position 3)
  #                         - insert | i [pos] (e.g 'i 3', insert into position 3. Pos parameter can be omitted and
  #                                  the new
  #                                 issue will be inserted at the end )
