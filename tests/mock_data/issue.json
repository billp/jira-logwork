In the example screenshot below you can see converted dates and times as underlined while the mouse hover shows the JIRA server time (relative dates e.g.Today 2:30pm are also converted): \r\n\r\n!times.png!\r\n\r\nPlease note that the plugin will not convert times in the issue navigator nor when entering dates/times in issues, it only currently works on the view issue display. \r\n\r\nIf you are interested in testing MyZone you can [download|https://plugins.atlassian.com/plugin/details/29054?versionId=29055] the plugin from the Atlassian Plugin Exchange. Please note that it is not an Atlassian supported plugin but the developer is keen to hear your thoughts and feedback.
