## Features

▫️ Create your daily work hours table using a command line wizard or an one-line command. <br />
▫️ Specify the **issue id** and optionally the duration and start time, then let the tool expand the time as needed to fill your daily work hours.

Run the following command in Terminal:
```bash
jira-logwork setup
```

## Manually Change Configuration
You can manually change the configuration parameters with the following command:

```bash
jira-logwork config [param] [[value1] [value2] ...]
```
